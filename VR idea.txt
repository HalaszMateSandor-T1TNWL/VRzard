Fighting game, Guilty Gear Type?

Wizard PvP - Online UDP/TCP
LowPoly 
Verticality, with floating platforms

Hand Gestures:
	Spellbook in one hand
	Pre-chosen spells are inside
	Gesture displayed in front of player as projection (can be turned off)
	When clicked on a spell the gesture is displayed
	Two spells can be combined at max, and gestures of those spells also combine (pre written, not calculated)
	Locomotion - basic movement
	Teleportation - also movement, but a spell as well (has cooldown)
		Self explanatory what the spell would look like
	Armswinger - also movement, but a spell as well (has cooldown)
		Maybe a gust of wind gets shut behind the player and launches them forward
		Maybe tentacles shoot out the pull the player to a certain location
	Hp and stats are displayed on left side of the book (kind of like how you would keep track of stats in DnD)
	Both hands could be used to draw the gestures once the spell is chosen
