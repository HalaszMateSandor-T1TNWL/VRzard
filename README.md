## The beginning concept of the game would be the following:
Genre: Fighting Game, Wizard PvP
Low Poly graphics, a DnD-style setting
Verticality, with potential floating platforms or higher points of interest

THE GIMIC:
Spellcasting is done via hand gestures (pre-determined shapes the players would have to draw over)
First the player chooses a spell from their spellbook (brought up by looking at their palm on either hand)
Then they click on the spell they wish to cast, which would project the shape the player needs to draw in front of them
    There could be combinations of spells, which would combine the shape of those two selected spells
Once the spell has been chosen the spellbook could be put away (by facing the palm away from the headset) and both hands could be used to trace over the lines
After a spell has been cast, there would be a cooldown on that certain spell (in case of combined spells, it would affect both of them)
Movement:
    Basic locomotion (controlled via the joysticks located on the controllers)
    Teleportation - also movement, but a spell as well (has cooldown)
        Self explanatory, how it would look like
    Armswingger - also movement, but a spell as well (has cooldown)
        Maybe a gust of wind is shot behind the player ?
        Maybe some tentacles reach out, in front of the player and pulls them there ?
UI:
  HP and stats would be displayed on the left side of the spellbook, kind of like how you would do it in pen-and-paper DnD!
